Meet PicoBear! \
Have you ever set your own screen time just to find yourself pressing ignore every time you receive a reminder? Or have you downloaded a productivity app that locks you out of social media and find that it never helps?

Our project is a lockbox with a timer, display, LEDs, and ultrasonic sensor, and is the ultimate productivity tool! \
The hour and minutes buttons are used to set a timer, and the timer is started by pressing the set button. The display counts down the timer, telling you how long to wait. If you reach for your phone before the timer is up, the LEDs will flash red.

Watch the demo [here]()! 

We made this project to reduce screen usage and improve productivity. Not only does this increase productivity by minimizing distractions, it also helps clear your mind and take effective breaks without screens.
