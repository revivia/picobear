Meet PicoBear! \
Have you ever set your own screen time just to find yourself pressing ignore every time you receive a reminder? Or have you downloaded a productivity app that locks you out of social media and find that it never helps?

Our project is a lockbox with a timer, display, LEDs, and ultrasonic sensor, and is the ultimate productivity tool! \
The hour and minutes buttons are used to set a timer, and the timer is started by pressing the set button. The display counts down the timer, and only when the timer is finished, the box will open. If you attempt to unlock the box before the timer is up, the LEDs will flash red.

We made this project to reduce screen usage and improve productivity. Not only does this increase productivity by minimizing distractions, it also helps clear your mind and take effective breaks without screens.
